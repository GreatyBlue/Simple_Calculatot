#Python Calculator

A simple and interactive calculator built in Python with colorful terminal outputs using the termcolor library. The calculator supports basic arithmetic operations like addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division, and provides a visually appealing interface with colors.

Installation Instructions

Follow the steps below to get the Colorful Python Calculator up and running on your local machine:

1. Prerequisites

Before you start, make sure you have the following installed:

Python 3.x (You can download Python from the official Python website).

pip (Python's package installer).


2. Clone the Repository

First, clone this repository to your local machine using the following command:

git clone https://github.com/GreatyBlue/Simple_Calculatot.git

Navigate into the project directory:

cd Simple_Calculatot

3. Install Required Dependencies

The project requires the termcolor package to handle colorful terminal outputs. To install termcolor, run the following command:

pip install termcolor

This will install the termcolor package, which is used to add colors to the text displayed by the calculator.

4. Running the Calculator

Once the dependencies are installed, you can run the Python calculator script. Use the following command to start the calculator:

python calculator.py

Alternatively, if you'd like to make the script executable, use the following command:

chmod +x calculator.py
./calculator.py

5. Using the Calculator

Once the script is running, you can choose an operation (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, etc.), provide the required numbers, and get a colorful result displayed in the terminal.
